# Forkify_own_version

Forkify app is from a Udemy course.  I followed along and coded once during the course.  This version was recreated after the course was completed to solidify my JS understanding.

All HTML and SASS was written by the Udemy course instructor.  All JS for this version was written by me.

The JS follows the MVC architecture and utilizes an API created by the Udemy course instructor, Jonas Schmedtmann.
